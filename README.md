# About
  My config is a branch of [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). It is not a branch as I made this repo after I pulled this down
## Some Neat stuff
I use Mason for LSP, to make my life easier, I also use telescoping (because who doesnt)

# Plugins
you may notice the rather odd plugin inside the /plugin directory. This is for my personal LSP that I have been working on for markdown files (like this one!), this project is not currently public but may be in the future.

# Thank you for reading!!
